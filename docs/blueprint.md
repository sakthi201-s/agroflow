# **App Name**: AgriFlow

## Core Features:

- Organization Management: Manage organizations which supply fertilizers and seeds.
- Customer Management: Manage individual customer data for company 1 (fertilizer and seeds).
- Farmer Management: Manage farmer data for company 2 (maize import/export).
- Stock Management: Inventory tracking for fertilizer, seeds, and maize, per company.
- Billing System: Generate bills for both companies (sales of fertilizer/seeds, export of maize)
- AI Inventory Forecaster: AI-powered tool to forecast optimal stock levels based on seasonal demands, incorporating historical data. Provide notifications when stock levels are out of expected values. This could prevent loss of revenue or waste from excessive inventory.
- Executive Dashboard: Dashboard to display at-a-glance profitability per company, overall stock value, and upcoming billing and payments.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted cyan (#70AFA3) to evoke nature and growth, while avoiding agricultural cliches like greens and browns.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F2F1), almost the same hue as the primary but heavily desaturated, for a clean and calm backdrop.
- Accent color: Desaturated yellow (#CDB37C), an analogous hue to the primary color that is slightly different in brightness and saturation, for subtle highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern-looking but still approachable sans-serif for a balance of readability and contemporary style
- Simple, line-based icons for a clean and efficient UI.
- A clean, tabular layout for data presentation. The tabular data should support export into CSV.
- Subtle transitions when toggling companies on the dashboard.
